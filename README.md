Project requirements
Set up a new project with webpack that is based on the webpack exercise you have already completed. - DONE
Create an index.html file and write your HTML markup here. Create an empty To Do List placeholder (<div> or <ul> element). The index.html file must be set as a template using the HTML Webpack Plugin. - DONE
Create an index.js file and set an array of some simple to do tasks (array of objects). Each task object should contain three keys: - DONE
description [string]. - DONE
completed [bool]. - DONE
index: [number]. - DONE
Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task. - DONE
On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. The list should appear in order of the index values for each task. - DONE
Create a style.css and set rules for the To Do List. CSS must be loaded by Webpack Style/CSS Loader. Your list should be a clone of the part of the minimalist project captured in the video below.
